    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>For some reason, writing even a short paragraph with a topic of “about me” has always been challenging. That said, I’ll start with the standard stuff! I grew up in Blacksburg, Virginia in a family of seven and I moved out to Portland in 2013. In addition to those two locations, I’ve also lived in Massachusetts, Georgia, and California, but Oregon is, without a doubt, my home.My areas of interest are rather broad and disconnected, but include topics such Chinese and Ayurvedic medicine, saltwater reef aquariums, meditation, <strong>coding</strong>, music, video games, and Studio Ghibli films.
