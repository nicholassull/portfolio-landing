      <p>For some reason, writing even a short paragraph with a topic of “about me” has always been challenging. That said, I’ll start with the standard stuff! I grew up in Blacksburg, Virginia in a family of seven and I moved out to Portland in 2013. In addition to those two locations, I’ve also lived in Massachusetts, Georgia, and California, but Oregon is, without a doubt, my home. My areas of interest are rather broad and disconnected, but include topics such Chinese and Ayurvedic medicine, saltwater reef aquariums, meditation, <strong>coding</strong>, music, video games, and Studio Ghibli films.

      <p id="background">After highschool, I immediately went to <span class="school">Portland State University</span> with the intention of majoring in cultural anthropology. However, I was lucky enough to realize, after the first semester, that my decision to enroll in college was too hasty. I ended up leaving PSU to work and save for a trip to a monastery in Argentina. What I learned during my trip there eventually led me to study Ayurvedic medicine for a year at the <span class="school">California College of Ayurveda</span> — an education that's played a huge role in my life since.</p>
